Hi! I'm fairly new to Camel, but it seems like a tool that is well-suited for my current situation: I am trying to ingest MQTT messages from a broker and forward them to AWS SQS. I have identified two built-in components paho and aws-sqs that can be used to achieve this. The data volume is roughly 500 messages/sec, and each message sits at roughly 1.4KB. I've successfully set up a proof-of-concept that works, but it is unable to process more than 30 messages/sec and the rest of the messages are presumably lost.
I assume this is mostly due to the small message size (one message -> one SQS message), and to mitigate this I'd like to aggregate messages before sending them to SQS.
