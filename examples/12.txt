A customer has a use case where they want the Camel's route to continue consuming from Kinesis at the last consumed message after restarting the POD. To achieve this, Kinesis has a "checkpoint" feature. Unfortunately, Camel Kinesis component lacks the checkpoint support.

However, it supports Resume API (I had to glean this information from GitHub because there is hardly any documentation, testing or examples available neither upstream).

Then I would suggest implementing a ResumeAdapter that supports `checkpoint` starting from `KinesisDefaultResumeAdapter`. But I don't know where to start from.Â  Any Advice?
