I'm trying to find a way to do the following. receiving a message from a broker queue, then querying hazelcast cache for recipients of the message based on a property of the message and finally splitting and send a http request for each recipient. I can read from the queue and send http,but how can i query hazelcast cache in the middle of processing and get the list of recipients then use the split pattern to send the each http request? any hints will be appreciated
