I am having an issue while working on the requirement. The requirement is I am having 2 routes. One route is just to listen the events generated by 2nd route and aggregates them and push it to destination for every 10 mins.
How can be able to listen to the events of one route by another route in Apache Camel?

To listen to the events of one route by another route in Apache Camel, you can use the Aggregator pattern. The Aggregator allows you to combine a number of messages together into a single message. It collects and stores individual messages until a complete set of related messages has been received, and then publishes a single message distilled from the individual messages.

You can use the Aggregator pattern to aggregate the events generated by the second route and push them to the destination for every 10 minutes. The logic for combining messages together is correlated in buckets based on a correlation key. Messages with the same correlation key are aggregated together using an AggregationStrategy.

Here's an example of how you can use the Aggregator pattern in Apache Camel to achieve this:

from("secondRoute")
    .aggregate(constant(true), new MyAggregationStrategy())
        .completionInterval(600000) // 10 minutes
        .to("destination");

In this example, "secondRoute" is the route that generates events, and the Aggregator is used to aggregate the events and push them to the "destination" for every 10 minutes.

Additionally, you can use the AggregateController to control the aggregation at runtime using Java or JMX API. This can be used to force completing groups of exchanges or query its current runtime statistics.
