I want to read a local file, create equally sized parts of 50kb. After that each part should be stored separately in AWS S3. Can you show me an example in Java?

To achieve this, you can use Apache Camel to read a local file, split it into equally sized parts, and then store each part separately in AWS S3. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using Java and Apache Camel:

import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class FileSplitterRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() throws Exception {
        from("file:/path/to/local/directory?noop=true&fileName=yourfile.txt")
            .split().tokenize("\n").streaming()
            .aggregate(constant(true), new MyAggregationStrategy())
                .completionSize(50 * 1024)
                .to("aws2-s3://your-bucket-name?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey");
    }
}

In this example:

We use the file component to read a file from a local directory.
We then split the file into equally sized parts using the split and aggregate EIPs.
The aggregate EIP is used to aggregate the parts into a single message with a completion size of 50kb.
Finally, we use the aws2-s3 component to store each part separately in AWS S3.
Please replace /path/to/local/directory, yourfile.txt, your-bucket-name, yourAccessKey, and yourSecretKey with your actual values.

This example demonstrates how to read a local file, split it into equally sized parts, and store each part separately in AWS S3 using Apache Camel.
