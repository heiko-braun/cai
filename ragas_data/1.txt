I want to read a local file, create equal chunks and store in AWS S3. Can you show  me how to do that?

To read a local file, create equal chunks, and store them in AWS S3 using Apache Camel, you can use the AWS2-S3 component. Here's an example of how you can achieve this in Java:

from("file://inputFolder")
    .split(body().tokenize("\n")).streaming()
    .to("aws2-s3://myBucket?accessKey=yourAccessKey&secretKey=yourSecretKey&region=us-west-2");

In this example, we use the file component to read files from the local directory "inputFolder". We then split the file content into equal chunks and use the aws2-s3 component to store the chunks in the AWS S3 bucket "myBucket" using the provided access key, secret key, and region.

This example demonstrates how to read a local file, split it into equal chunks, and store them in AWS S3 using Apache Camel and the AWS2-S3 component.
